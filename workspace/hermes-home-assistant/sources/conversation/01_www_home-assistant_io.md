The **Conversation** integrationIntegrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.[ [Learn more]](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations) allows you to converse with Home Assistant. You can either converse by pressing the microphone in the frontend (supported browsers only (no iOS)) or by calling the `conversation.process` action with the transcribed text.

# Example base configuration.yaml entry

## Default sentences 
By default, a collection of [community contributed sentences](https://github.com/home-assistant/intents/) are supported in a growing [list of languages](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/supported-languages).
In English, you can say things like “turn on kitchen lights” or “turn off lights in the bedroom” if you have an area named “bedroom”.
## Sentence triggers 
Sentence triggers start an automation when Assist matches a sentence. They use the default conversation agent and work with Home Assistant Assist. External conversation agents, such as OpenAI Conversation or Google Generative AI Conversation, only use sentence triggers when **Prefer handling commands locally** is enabled.
Sentence triggers use the same [template sentence syntax](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/template-sentence-syntax) as custom sentences. You can define optional words with square brackets and alternatives with parentheses.
TriggerA trigger is a set of values or conditions of a platform that are defined to cause an automation to run.[ [Learn more]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/)

```
trigger: conversation
command:
  - "[it's ]party time"
  - "happy (new year|birthday)"
```

YAML
Copy
The first example matches both “party time” and “it’s party time”. The second example matches both “happy new year” and “happy birthday”. Punctuation and capitalization are ignored.
For a complete example, see [adding a custom sentence to trigger an automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/custom_sentences/#adding-a-custom-sentence-to-trigger-an-automation).
### Sentence wildcards 
You can use lists as wildcards to capture text from the matched sentence. Captured text is available in `trigger.slots`. For the full data structure, including `trigger.details`, see [sentence trigger data](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/templating/#sentence).
AutomationAutomations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen in and around your home.[ [Learn more]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/)

```
triggers:
  - trigger: conversation
    command: "play {album} by {artist}"
actions:
  - action: media_player.play_media
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.living_room
    data:
      media_content_id: "{{ trigger.slots.album }}"
      media_content_type: "album"
```

YAML
Copy
Wildcards match greedily. If a wildcard captures more text than expected, add extra words around the wildcard to make the sentence more specific.
### Inline number ranges 
Number ranges can be matched with ranges like `{0..100:brightness}`. This matches numbers from `0` to `100` and stores the value in the `brightness` slot. It works for digits and words, so the sentence `set brightness to {0..100:brightness} percent` matches both “set brightness to 50 percent” and “set brightness to fifty percent”.
In both cases, `trigger.slots.brightness` is `50`. To get the spoken or written text, use `trigger.details`, such as `trigger.details.brightness.text`.
## Adding custom sentences 
You can add your own [sentence templates](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/template-sentence-syntax) to teach Home Assistant about new sentences. These sentences can work with the [built-in intents](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_builtin/) or trigger a custom action by defining custom intentsIntent is a term used with voice assistants. The intent is what Home Assistant thinks you want it to do when it extracts a command from your voice or text utterance.[ [Learn more]](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_builtin) with the [intent script integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/intent_script/).
To get started, create a `custom_sentences/<language>` directory in your Home Assistant `config` directory where `<language>` is the [language code](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/supported-languages) of your language, such as `en` for English. These YAML files are automatically merged, and may contain intents, lists, or expansion rules.
For an English example, create the file `config/custom_sentences/en/temperature.yaml` and add:

```
# Example temperature.yaml entry
language: "en"
intents:
  CustomOutsideHumidity:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "What is the humidity outside"
```

YAML
Copy
To teach Home Assistant how to handle the custom `CustomOutsideHumidity` intentIntent is a term used with voice assistants. The intent is what Home Assistant thinks you want it to do when it extracts a command from your voice or text utterance.[ [Learn more]](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_builtin), create an `intent_script` entry in your `configuration.yaml`The configuration.yaml file is the main configuration file for Home Assistant. It lists the integrations to be loaded and their specific configurations. In some cases, the configuration needs to be edited manually directly in the configuration.yaml file. Most integrations can be configured in the UI.[ [Learn more]](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) file:

```
# Example configuration.yaml entry
intent_script:
  CustomOutsideHumidity:
    speech:
      text: "It is currently {{ states('sensor.outside_humidity') }} percent humidity outside."
```

YAML
Copy
More complex [actions](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/) can be done in `intent_script`, such as performing actions and firing events.
## Extending built-in intents 
Extending the built-in intentsIntent is a term used with voice assistants. The intent is what Home Assistant thinks you want it to do when it extracts a command from your voice or text utterance.[ [Learn more]](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_builtin), such as `HassTurnOn` and `HassTurnOff`, can be done as well.
For example, create the file `config/custom_sentences/en/on_off.yaml` and add:

```
# Example on_off.yaml entry
language: "en"
intents:
  HassTurnOn:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "engage [the] kitchen lights"
        slots:
          name: "kitchen lights"
  HassTurnOff:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "disengage [the] kitchen lights"
        slots:
          name: "kitchen lights"
```

YAML
Copy
Now when you say “engage the kitchen lights”, it will turn on a light named “kitchen lights”. Saying “disengage kitchen lights” will turn it off.
Let’s generalize this to other entities. The built-in `{name}` and `{area}` lists contain the names of your Home Assistant entities and areas.
Adding `{name}` to `config/custom_sentences/en/on_off.yaml`:

```
# Example on_off.yaml entry
language: "en"
intents:
  HassTurnOn:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "engage [the] {name}"
  HassTurnOff:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "disengage [the] {name}"
```

YAML
Copy
You can now “engage” or “disengage” any entity.
Lastly, let’s add sentences for turning lights on and off in specific areas:

```
# Example on_off.yaml entry
language: "en"
intents:
  HassTurnOn:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "engage [the] {name}"
      - sentences:
          - "engage [all] lights in [the] {area}"
        slots:
          name: "all"
          domain: "light"
  HassTurnOff:
    data:
      - sentences:
          - "disengage [the] {name}"
      - sentences:
          - "disengage [all] lights in [the] {area}"
        slots:
          name: "all"
          domain: "light"
```

YAML
Copy
It’s now possible to say “engage all lights in the bedroom”, which will turn on every light in the area named “bedroom”.
