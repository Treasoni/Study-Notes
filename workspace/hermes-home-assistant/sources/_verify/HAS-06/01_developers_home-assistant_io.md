Permissions limit the things a user has access to or can control. Permissions are attached to groups, of which a user can be a member. The combined permissions of all groups a user is a member of decides what a user can and cannot see or control.
Permissions do not apply to the user that is flagged as "owner". This user will always have access to everything.
## General permission structure[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#general-permission-structure "Direct link to General permission structure")
Policies are dictionaries that at the root level consist of different categories of permissions. In the current implementation this is limited to just entities.

```



"entities":{





```

Each category can further split into subcategories that describe parts of that category.

```



"entities":{




"domains":{






"entity_ids":{






```

If a category is omitted, the user will not have permission to that category.
When defining a policy, any dictionary value at any place can be replaced with `True` or `None`. `True` means that permission is granted and `None` means use default, which is deny access.
## Entities[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#entities "Direct link to Entities")
Entity permissions can be set on a per entity and per domain basis using the subcategories `entity_ids`, `device_ids`, `area_ids` and `domains`. You can either grant all access by setting the value to `True`, or you can specify each entity individually using the "read", "control", "edit" permissions.
The system will return the first matching result, based on the order: `entity_ids`, `device_ids`, `area_ids`, `domains`, `all`.

```



  "entities": {




    "domains": {




      "switch": true





    "entity_ids": {




      "light.kitchen": {




        "read": true,




        "control": true






```

## Merging policies[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#merging-policies "Direct link to Merging policies")
If a user is a member of multiple groups, the groups permission policies will be combined into a single policy at runtime. When merging policies, we will look at each level of the dictionary and compare the values for each source using the following methodology:
  1. If any of the values is `True`, the merged value becomes `True`.
  2. If any value is a dictionary, the merged value becomes a dictionary created by recursively checking each value using this methodology.
  3. If all values are `None`, the merged value becomes `None`.


Let's look at an example:

```



"entities":{




"entity_ids":{




"light.kitchen":True





```


```



"entities":{




"entity_ids":True




```

Once merged becomes

```



"entities":{




"entity_ids":True




```

## Checking permissions[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#checking-permissions "Direct link to Checking permissions")
We currently have two different permission checks: can the user do the read/control/edit operation on an entity, and is the user an admin and thus allowed to change this configuration setting.
Certain APIs will always be accessible to all users, but might offer a limited scope based on the permissions, like rendering a template.
### Checking permissions[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#checking-permissions-1 "Direct link to Checking permissions")
To check a permission, you will need to have access to the user object. Once you have the user object, checking the permission is easy.

```


from homeassistant.exceptions import Unauthorized




from homeassistant.auth.permissions.const import POLICY_READ, POLICY_CONTROL, POLICY_EDIT





# Raise error if user is not an admin




ifnot user.is_admin:




raise Unauthorized()






# Raise error if user does not have access to control an entity




# Available policies: POLICY_READ, POLICY_CONTROL, POLICY_EDIT




ifnot user.permissions.check_entity(entity_id, POLICY_CONTROL):




raise Unauthorized()


```

### The context object[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#the-context-object "Direct link to The context object")
All service actions, fired events and states in Home Assistant have a context object. This object allows us to attribute changes to events and actions. These context objects also contain a user id, which is used for checking the permissions.
It's crucial for permission checking that actions taken on behalf of the user are done with a context containing the user ID. If you are in a service action handler, you should reuse the incoming context `call.context`. If you are inside a WebSocket API or Rest API endpoint, you should create a context with the correct user:

```


from homeassistant.core import Context





await hass.services.async_call(




"homeassistant","stop", context=Context(user_id=user.id), blocking=True



```

### If a permission check fails[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#if-a-permission-check-fails "Direct link to If a permission check fails")
When you detect an unauthorized action, you should raise the `homeassistant.exceptions.Unauthorized` exception. This exception will cancel the current action and notifies the user that their action is unauthorized.
The `Unauthorized` exception has various parameters, to identify the permission check that failed. All fields are optional.  
| Parameter  | Description  |  
| --- | --- |  
| context  | The context of the current call.  |  
| user_id  | The user ID that we tried to operate on.  |  
| entity_id  | The entity ID that we tried to operate on.  |  
| config_entry_id  | The config entry ID that we tried to operate on.  |  
| perm_category  | The permission category that we tested. Only necessary if we don't have an object ID that the user tried to operate on (like when we create a config entry).  |  
| permission  | The permission that we tested, ie `POLICY_READ`.  |  
### Securing a service action handler[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#securing-a-service-action-handler "Direct link to Securing a service action handler")
Actions allow a user to control entities or with the integration as a whole. A service action uses the attached context to see which user invoked the command. Because context is used, it is important that you also pass the call context to all service action.
All service actions that are registered via the entity component (`component.async_register_entity_service()`) will automatically have their permissions checked.
#### Checking entity permissions[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#checking-entity-permissions "Direct link to Checking entity permissions")
Your service action handler will need to check the permissions for each entity that it will act on.

```


from homeassistant.exceptions import Unauthorized, UnknownUser




from homeassistant.auth.permissions.const import POLICY_CONTROL






asyncdefhandle_entity_service(call: ServiceCall)-None:




"""Handle a service action call."""




    entity_ids = call.data["entity_id"]





for entity_id in entity_ids:




if call.context.user_id:




            user =await hass.auth.async_get_user(call.context.user_id)





if user isNone:




raise UnknownUser(




                    context=call.context,




                    entity_id=entity_id,




                    permission=POLICY_CONTROL,






ifnot user.permissions.check_entity(entity_id, POLICY_CONTROL):




raise Unauthorized(




                    context=call.context,




                    entity_id=entity_id,




                    permission=POLICY_CONTROL,






# Do action on entity






asyncdefasync_setup(hass: HomeAssistant, config: ConfigType)-bool:




    hass.services.async_register(DOMAIN,"my_service", handle_entity_service)




returnTrue


```

#### Checking admin permission[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#checking-admin-permission "Direct link to Checking admin permission")
There is a special helper to protect service actions that require admin access.

```


from homeassistant.helpers.service import async_register_admin_service






asyncdefhandle_admin_service(call: ServiceCall)-None:




"""Handle a service action call."""




# Do admin action






asyncdefasync_setup(hass: HomeAssistant, config: ConfigType)-bool:




    async_register_admin_service(




        hass, DOMAIN,"my_service", handle_admin_service, vol.Schema({})





returnTrue


```

### Securing a REST API endpoint[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#securing-a-rest-api-endpoint "Direct link to Securing a REST API endpoint")

```


from homeassistant.core import Context




from homeassistant.components.http.view import HomeAssistantView




from homeassistant.exceptions import Unauthorized






classMyView(HomeAssistantView):




"""View to handle Status requests."""





    url ="/api/my-component/my-api"




    name ="api:my-component:my-api"





asyncdefpost(self, request):




"""Notify that the API is running."""




        hass = request.app["hass"]




        user = request["hass_user"]





ifnot user.is_admin:




raise Unauthorized()





        hass.bus.async_fire(




"my-component-api-running", context=Context(user_id=user.id)






return self.json_message("Done.")


```

### Securing a Websocket API endpoint[​](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_permissions/#securing-a-websocket-api-endpoint "Direct link to Securing a Websocket API endpoint")
Verifying permissions in a Websocket API endpoint can be done by accessing the user via `connection.user`. If you need to check admin access, you can use the built-in `@require_admin` decorator.

```


from homeassistant.components import websocket_api






asyncdefasync_setup(hass: HomeAssistant, config: ConfigType)-bool:




    websocket_api.async_register_command(hass, websocket_create)




returnTrue






@websocket_api.require_admin




@websocket_api.async_response




@websocket_api.websocket_command(




{vol.Required("type"):"my-component/my-action",}





asyncdefwebsocket_create(




    hass: HomeAssistant,




    connection: ActiveConnection,




    msg:dict,




)-None:




"""Create a user."""
